# risk-of-heart-failure-using-machine-learning
Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.  

Early detection, and managment of cardiovascular diseases can be a great way to manage the fatality rate associated with cardiovascular diseases, and this is where a machine learning model comes in. 

For the purpose of predicting the risk of a  heart failure in patients, I used the Logistic Regression  Classifier to build a machine learning model, and deployed it using Flask and Heroku.
You can use the deployed model at : https://www.software-eng.net/
